  "A map that is in charge for your ev"

## Summary ##
  This web app provides information through map about the available and ready to use charging stations for electric vehicles. As user of this app (and owner of an ev) you can search in the map and find charging points for your ev in the area of your interest (only for Greek market at the moment). In this way the road trip can easily be well organized.

## Problem ##
  At the moment, while the ev share is expanding day by day, in Greece there are some apps that include information for charging stations provided only by users. There is not any official authority behind that. So, if a new charging station will be installed, it will be unknown for everyone until a user add this information in the app.

## Solution ##
  With the "m.inCharge" app, the management of the whole network of charging stations will be under the supervision of the Ministry of Transport and Public Electricity Company, which will know about the new chargers that will be installed as the license that allows this installation must be provided by these two authorities. In this way, the new chargers will be shown to the map from day one with all the necessary technical and economical data for the user.

## How to Get Started ##
  1) Go to the "m.inCharge" website.
  2) Click on the 'map' link and search about what you need.
  3) If you want to send a feedback to the admins (for a damaged charger for example), create an 'user' account and fill in the form.
  4) If you have 'admin' access, you have to create an account with username, email and password provided by the Ministry of Transport. After that you can add, edit and delete markers (including their data) to the map.
